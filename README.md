# CO-CREATE

This work is performed by researcher Jonas Rekdal Mathisen at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health for work packages two and three in the CO-CREATE project (https://www.fhi.no/en/studies/co-create/). It is funded by the European Union. 

The scripts are from different stages of the project and made as new data were made available. The first script was the 'Implementation of healthy eating policies across Europe'. This used the publicly available data from World Cancer Research Fund's policy database (http://policydatabase.wcrf.org). It is now outdated but can still be used for the online database to create a simple index. This script was followed by a new version using an offline database ('Policy database analysis for NOURISHIGN'). 

To create the index, we initially used COINr package  ('Index construction with new COINr methodology'). Here the results from the benchmarking/survey collection is aggregated. We later moved parts of this to excel to facilitate non R-users. The advantage of this script is the flexibility and visualisation that is not available in Excel worbooks. 

The results from the aggregation procedures are made available in two similar scripts; NOURISHING and MOVING visualisation. These provide publication figures for both frameworks using the Excel workbook. 

Lastly, a script named 'Correlation of ranks between different models' can be used to perform analyses of different categorical outcomes across models. It uses Kendell's correlation to assess how close the categorical outcomes of different models are and may be useful in future refinement of the tools. 

Best,
